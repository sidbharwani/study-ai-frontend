# Study AI - Frontend
This is the **frontend** for my summer project **Study AI**, a web app that is built to make studying faster, responsive, and more effective. 
This frontend is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and connects to a **Cloudfare Worker backend** that calls the **OpenAI Api**.

This app allows you to: 
* Generate **flashcards**
* Create **practice tessts**
* Build **study guides**
* Get **step-by-step solutions**

## Why I Built This? 
Most study platforms (Quizlet, Kahoot, Chegg), even though use AI to make  preparation of guides, flashcards, and tests easier and faster, I wanted to make an AI chat-centric interface so that without learning the platform, one can automatically shoot a text to AI and instruct it to do the following features mentioned above. 

With **Study AI**, you can type your topic, and AI instantly creates ready-to-use study content. 

This backend powers that experience - securely, reliably, and at scale.
